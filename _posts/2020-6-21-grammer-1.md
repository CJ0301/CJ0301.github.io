> 在句子中起名词作用的从句叫名词性从句。

## 概念
名词性从句功能类似于名词短语，能在复合句中担任主语、宾语、表语、同位语等。按不同的语法功能又可划分成主语从句、宾语从句、表语从句、同位语从句。

## 名词性从句
一般做题步骤：

第一步：V$\geqslant$2,从属连词=V-1  
$$\Rightarrow该句子为复合句\begin{cases}
主句完整 \begin{cases}
定 \\
状 \\
同(主句完整、主句名词抽象、从句等同)
\end{cases}\\
主句不完整\begin{cases}
主 \\
宾 \\
表
\end{cases}
\end{cases}$$
(名词性从句不考虑定状，完整必然是同位语)

第二步：看连接词在从句中充当什么成分  
连接代词：what，which，who，whom +ever(8个)[n] 做主宾表语    
连接副词：when，where，how +ever why，whether(8个)[adv] 做状语  
连接形容词：what，which，whose +ever (6个)[adj] 做定语  
狭义连接词：that，if，as if，(1个) 不做成分  

特殊情况：当遇到一些介词时where也可做连接代词，如：    
Tell me where do you come from？  

但大多数还是不用where的，如：  
Is this museum what you visited last week?  

第三步：看连接词意思


注意：  
- 判断从句类型看主句，选连接词看从句
- 从句统一用陈述句语序
- 宾从第一个that可省略；whether适用范围大于if；介词后一般不用that
- 同位语三要素：完整抽象等同；大多数都用that

刘晓燕老师说的：  
名词性从句的引导词根据从句的类型来  
分成三类：  

1.陈述句
That he has got divorced is my fault.

2.一般疑问句
Whether he got divorced is obvious. 

3.特殊疑问句
Who will he marry is a secret.


#### 典型名词从句
一、主语位置  
1.Something is strange.  
2.He didn't show up on time.  
->That he didn't show up on time is strange.  
->It is strange that he didn't show up on time.  

两种形式中第二句话都是第一句话代替something的存在，是名词性从句做主语。

二、宾语位置  
1.The defendant said something.  
2.He didn't do it.  
->The defendant said that he didn't do it.  

这里的第二句话代替第一句的something，是名词性从句做宾语。

与主从的区别在于，这里的that可以省略。

1.I find something strange.  
2.He didn't show up on time.  
->I find it strange that he didn't show up on time.  
这里为了避免宾语从句太长，先用虚词it指代，然后将从句后移。

三、补语位置  
The car is ruined.The important thing is that we're all rignt.  

与宾语从句一样，若不产生断句困难以及意思混淆，可以去掉that。

四、同位语位置  
名词性从句与一个名词位置相同称为同位语从句，通常在抽象名词之后(如fact,idea,hope,wish等)，做解释说明作用。  
I've got a feeling that one day he'll be famous.

I am afraid that I can't help you.  
这句话乍一看没有名词位置放这个名词性从句，其实是这句话经过了省略。

1.I am afraid of that thing.  
2.I can't help you.  
句2在语句中充当了thing的同位语，因为其没有意义，与从句重复，且of that thing是可有可无的介系词短语，所以可以省略。

名词从句放大    
有时名词性从句的内容比主从重要，可以将其放入逗号当中。例如：    
1.This is your last offer,I suppose?  
2.I suppose that this is your last offer?

1.The earthquake was a 6.9,said Dr.Chang,Director of the...  
2.Dr.Chang,Director of the...,said that the earthquake was a 6.9.

#### 疑问句改装的名词从句  
典型名词是外加连接词that，表示那件事(that thing)。同时，以疑问词(who、what、when等)引导的疑问句，也可以改装成名词性从句，代表一个问题(the question)。例如：  
1.I know the question.  
2.Who are you?  
->I know who you are.  

在更改成名词性从句后，语序得改成陈述句语序。

1.The question is anybody's guess.
2.When will the bomb go off?
->When the bomb will go off is anybody's guess.

Whether和if    
1.I can't tell which.  
2.Either he's telling the truth or he's not.  
->I can't tell whether/if he's telling the truth or not.

一般情况二者可互换，在句首或前面又介词时只能用whether。

1.Either the tumor is malignant or it is not.    
2.The treatment will be decided by(the question) which.  
->The treatment will be decided by whether the tumor is malignant or not.

#### 连接代词引导的从句
连接词在从句中充当成分。  
1.Somebody must be rewarded.    
2.Somebody did the job.    
->Whoever did the job must be rewarded.    
二句代替一句中的Somebody，Whoever作为代词指代二句中的Somebody。

1.Something is not clear.  
2.The president can do something to end the strike.  
->It is by no means clear what the president can do to end the strike.  
二句代替一句中的Something，what作为代词指代二句中的Something。

#### 连接副词引导的从句
连接词在名词性从句中充当状语。  
1.Something makes no difference.  
2.We shall have the meeting in a place.  
->It makes no difference where we shall have the meeting.  
二句代替一句中的Something，where作为状语指代二句中的in a place。

1.My question has not been answered.  
2.I shall get in touch with him in a way.  
->My question how I shall get in touch with him has not been answered.  
二句为My question的同位语从句，how作为状语指代二句中的in a way。
