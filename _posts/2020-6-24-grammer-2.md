## 定语从句
1.I have an apple  
2.the apple is red  
->I have a red apple which is red.

关系词的作用   
1.引导从句    
2.在从句中做成分  
3.替代先行词  

$$做题步骤\Rightarrow\begin{cases}
1.从句为定语从句 \\
2.划出关键词 \\
3.先行词代入从句，看他在从句做什么成分 \\
4.根据成分得出关系词 \\
\end{cases}$$

$$选择\Rightarrow\begin{cases}
做主宾表\Rightarrow & 关系代词 [that/which/who/whom/as] \\
做状语 \Rightarrow & 关系副词 [when/where/why/介词+which] \\
做定语 \Rightarrow & 关系形容词 [whose=of whom/which]
\end{cases}$$

八个引导词(按先行词划分)  
人 who whom whose  
物 that which whose  
时间 that which when  
地点 that which where  
原因 that which why  

#### 关系词
一、关系代词  
缺宾语的情况  
1.及物动词2.介词3.动词双宾语

被动即完整(间接宾语除外)

关系代词作宾语可省略

二、关系副词  
1、关系代词与关系副词的差别  
This is the place that/which we visited last time.  
This is the place where we visited the equipment last time.

I still remember the time when we first met each other.  
I still remember the time that/which we spent together.

This is the reason why she cried.  
This is the reason that/which she gave me.

2、介词+which   
1.This is a house.  
2.Shakespeare was born in this house.  
->Is this the house where/in which Shakespeare was born.  

1.This is a place.  
2.we visited the equipment at the place.  
->This is the place where/at which we visited the equipment.  

where和in/at which都是做地点状语。

1.I still remember the time.  
2.we first met each other at the time.  
->I still remember the time when/at which we first met each other.

when和at which都是做时间状语

1.This is the reason.
2.she cried for a reason.
->This is the reason why/for which she cried.

why和for which都是做原因状语

例题：  
He was educated at the local high school, ___ he went on to Beijing University.  
A.after which B.after that C.in which D.in that
解析：A，因为是定语从句，which指代的是前面的事件，转化后的句子是After He was educated at the local high school,he went on to Beijing University. 

Villagers here depend on the fishing industry,without which there won't be much work.  
解析：这句的难点在于意思的解析，多去看看介词。

三、关系形容词
Girls' hair is black and long.  
-> He like girls whose hair is black and long.

The hair of the girls is black and long.
-> He like girls of whom hair is black and long.

#### 限制与非限制
非限制性定语从句的本质是，先行词已经唯一，从句只做补充说明作用。  
非限制定语从句比原来少了that和why的引导词   

考点：  
1.代唯一名词  
2.代整个主句(which,as)  
意思上，which指代这件事，as表示正如    
位置上，which放主句后，as表示任意  
3.时间(本质)  
which分先后，主句先发生，后评价  
as不分先后，不强调先后，把主句当成事实

例：  
we all know that the earth is round(宾语从句)  
As we all know the earth is round.
The earth is round,as we all know.
The earth,as we all know,is round.

That they found the murder surprised me.(主语从句)
They found the murder,which surprised me.
As we all know,they have found the murder.

#### 其他用法
一、定语从句的主谓一致  
I have an apple that is red.  
I have apples that are red.  
He is the only one of the students that has been abroad.    
This is one of the best books that have ever been written in English.

谓语动词的人称与先行词一致，且有the限定的时候一定是单数形式。

二、That、Which和As的区别  
只用that不用which  
a.当先行词为不定代词或或被不定代词修饰，如(all,little,everything,nothing等)  
Everything that he said is wrong.  

b.当先行词是序数词或最高级，或被序数词和最高级修饰时  
He is the best student that I have ever seen.

c.当先行词被the very,the only,the last等修饰时  
she is the only one that understands me.

d.当主语是以who或which开头的疑问句时
Which is the book that you'd like to buy?

e.当先行词既有人也有物时   
I will never forget the people and things that I was interested in.

只用which不用that    
a.非限制性定语从句  
You can buy whatever you want at the shopping center,which is very busy at the weekend.

b.介词+which  
She took her first degree at Gorton College and later helped found Lucy Cavendish College,of which she was an honorary fellow.

3.只用as不用that,which    
先行词含有so,such,as,the same时    
I'd like make friends with such as are positive.  
This is the same bike as I bought last month.  
She is so cute a girl as everyone wants to be with.  
She will marry as handsome and wealthy a man as she can find.
