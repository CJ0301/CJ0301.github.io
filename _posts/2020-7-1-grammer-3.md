状语从句：一个句子修饰另一个句子的动词  
一个完整的句子通过连接词连接另一个完整的句子  
从逻辑上划分，可分为并列句和状语从句  
其中并列句有四种：并列、转折、选择、因果  
状语从句有九种：时间、条件、原因、结果、让步、比较、目的、方式、地点

考点：$$\begin{cases}
时态 & 主将从现\\
连接词 \\
省略 \\
倒装 
\end{cases}$$

## 状从
#### 时态
I will call you when I arrive in London.  

The new secretary is supposed to report to the manager as soon as she arrives.

在状语从句中不用将来时，用其一般形式来代替。

精简：  
1.When表时间点，接瞬间动作，表突然  
I had just stepped out of the bathroom and was busily drying myself with a towel when I heard the steps.  

2.主从ing，尽量用while  
I was watching TV while my mum was cooking dinner.

3.随着用as
As time goes by...

4.when/while可以省略，as不可省略
We became friends when/while studing in high school.

5.自然而然用when
When water is heated,it will be changed into vapor.

## 时间状语从句
#### before，after，since
before：  
1.表示还未...就，还没来得及...就...
He had got on the train before I could say goodbye.

2.It will be/was+一段时间+before，表示多久之后才...
It will be a long time before we meet again.

常用句型  
It was not long before... 没过多久就  
It was long before... 过了很久才   
It will not be long before... 要不了多久就  
It will be long before... 要过很久才  
Hardly/Scarcely...before... 刚...就...  

after：  
after和before差不多，都是表示一个点的先后。

since：  
since主句谓语动词$$\begin{cases}
延续性 & 计时起点从动作或状态结束算起\\
非延续性 & 计时起点从动作或状态开始算起
\end{cases}$$

1.since从句常用一般过去，主句常用现完和现进。  
He has gone fishing frequetly since he was ill

I haven't seen him since he left Beijing.

2.It is/has been+一段时间+since从句，表示自从...有多长时间了。  
It is/has been six years since she graduated from the university.

#### till,until,not...until
till/until用于肯定句中，表示主句的动作一直持续到从句的动作发生或出现为止，主句谓语动词为延续性动词。  
Continue in this direction until you see a sign.

当用于否定句中时，表示主句的动作在从句的动作发生之后才开始。  
He didn't go to sleep until midnight.

not...until，意为直到...才...置于句首时，主句用倒装结构。  
步骤$$\begin{cases}
not  until提到句首 \\
倒主不倒从 \\
部分倒
\end{cases}$$    
Not until my tea became cool did I have time to drink it.

总结下来就是，肯定句就是动作持续到一个点，在这个点之后不做。否定句就是动作在这个时间点之前不做，时间点之后才开始做。

#### 一...就...
过去|将来
as soon as  
the moment/second/instant  
immediately/instantly/directly

As soon as you trust yourself,you will know how to live.  
The moment I heard the news,I hurried to the spot.


过去  
no sooner...than...       
hardly/scarcely/rarely...when/before...     
主句用过去完成，从句用一般过去，位于句首时主句需要倒装。  
We had hardly started when it began to rain.  
No sooner had he returned to England than he bought a house and went to live there.

拓展：  
every/next/each/the last time也可以引导时间状语  
Every time I see him,he is working hard. 

## 让步状语从句
让步状语从句表示尽管有某些不利于主句发生的条件，主句的情况仍能发生，或与主句发生的情况有落差。常见引导词有though、although、even if、even though等。  

1.although与though意思相同，一般可以互换，都可以与
